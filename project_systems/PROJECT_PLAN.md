* [ ] OAuth2 Authentication
* [ ] Interactive Menu to clearly ask the user what action they want to take.
* [ ] Limit set to how many emails are read and how many are processed in each scan initiated by the user.
* [ ] Implement a Database which logs the user's activity and keeps track of the emails scanned, emails unsubscribed to, emails deleted to, and time saved to have proof of results.
* [ ] CLI -> Web-App -> Chrome Extension with the Web App existing in the extension's popup

## Open Questions & Decisions to Make
* [e.g., Should monetization be a one-time fee or a subscription?]
* [e.g., Is a web app or a Chrome extension better for the MVP?]
* [e.g., Which UI library should I use?]
