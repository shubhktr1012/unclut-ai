### CODING PROTOCOL ###
- Write the absolute minimum code required.
-No Sweeping Changes
- Use the same naming conventions as the rest of the codebase.
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don't break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything, tell me clearly.
